In this session, you will practice framing a given problem as a machine learning problem:

- Team up with your neighbor(s).
- Choose a problem that interests you most. You can refer to [the sample datasets and goals](lab/datasets_and_goals.html).for inspiration.
- Frame your machine learning problem by addressing [the guiding questions](lab/guiding_questions.html).
- We have provided [an example](lab/example.html) for your reference.
- The teaching team is available and happy to brainstorm with you.
