Choose a dataset and its corresponding objective, and then try to address the following questions:

-   Is the provided dataset appropriate for the specified objective? What type of data would ideally solve your problem or research question? Are there better-suited datasets available on the internet for this objective?
-   Clearly define the expected input and the 'ideal' output. Determine if machine learning is the appropriate method for addressing this problem.
-   If machine learning is deemed suitable, what should the model aim to achieve? How would you measure the model's performance?
-   How would a human tackle this issue? Can you propose any heuristic methods to solve this problem?
-   What are the major steps required to resolve this problem?
-   Draw a diagram that illustrates the input, output, and key stages of the problem-solving process.
-   Which type of machine learning would be best suited for your problem?
-   What specific machine learning technique would be most effective for this problem?
